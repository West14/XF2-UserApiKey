Enter the store URL as a simple domain, such as <code>https://example.com</code>. The URL must not include a path, query parameters, or fragments (e.g., <code>https://example.com/store</code>, <code>?param=value</code>, or <code>#section</code> are not allowed). Additionally, the URL should not have a trailing slash (<code>https://example.com/</code> is invalid; use <code>https://example.com</code> instead).
